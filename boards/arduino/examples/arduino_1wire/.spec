<h1>1-wire</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the operation
of a bit bang 1-wire interface using an Arduino Duemilanove.
</p>

<p>
The sample code looks for one each of a DS18x20, a DS2438 and a DS2413. It reports
the values read from any of the devices found via the serial port (UART).
</p>

<p>
The 1-wire modules configuration allows the port pin carrying the 1-wire data to be 
configured.
